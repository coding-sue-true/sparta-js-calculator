# JavaScript Calculator

The aim of this repository is to build a calculator using only JavaScript code.

### Tasks
 Write a command line calculator application that has two settings, (b)asic and (a)dvanced.
- First you will need to ask the user for which calculator they want to use
- Then you will need to ask the user for the numbers to operate on.
- Then you need to work out what to do with the numbers, depending on what operation they choose.

#### Basic:
- Additon
- Multiplication
- Division
- Subtraction

#### Advanced:
- Power
- Square root

#### Setup
- There is no starter code for this app.

#### Hints
Get user input - var hello = prompt("What is your name")
Output to console - console.log(hello)

### Bonus task
- Add the following calculator feature into your app.

  * BMI Calculator
    * Calculate the BMI when given the height and weight - the user should be able to choose between the imperial and the metric system
      - BMI Link 1
      - BMI Link 1

### __SUPER__ Bonus task
- Add the following calculator feature into your app.

* Trip Calculator

 - This feature asks the user for four inputs; distance, fuel efficiency (mpg), cost per gallon, speed and it will give you the time and price of your journey.

>Example output: "Your trip will take 3.5 hours and cost Â£255.33.""

Note: For every 1 MPH over 60 MPH, reduce the the MPG by 2 MPG (i.e. a car that normally gets 30 mpg would only get 28 mpg if its speed were 61 mph. Yes this gets silly at high speed where mpg goes to zero or gets negative - how will you handle this?)

### __SUPER SUPER__ Bonus task
- Build an index.html page and style it

## Final Balance of the task

### Work in Progress
- Finish the __super super__ bonus task

### Most Difficult
- Initial 'snow ball' of code
- Didn't loose the track of 'if', 'else if' and 'else' statements;
- Get the bonus task working properly;
- Accomplish the Super Bonus task;
- Right size of buttons on the html code;

### Not that Difficult
- Building the index.html page and style it
